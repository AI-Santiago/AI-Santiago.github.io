I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Prior to that, I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Artificial Intelligence from Xi'an Jiaotong University.
My research interests include natural language processing, knowledge graph, data mining. 


I don't have much to show at the moment, so I may just share a quote that I really like.

"Why do we have to listen to our hearts?" the boy asked.
"Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you will find your treasure."

Any discussion, co-operation, mentoring and being mentored are very welcome, and I can be reached at liyifan@link.cuhk.edu.hk.

Thanks for reading!
