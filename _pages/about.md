I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. Irwin King. Prior to that, I received my B.Eng. degree in Artificial Intelligence from Qian Xuesen Honors College of Xi'an Jiaotong University.

I am particularly interested in knowledge representation and reasoning, recommender systems, and agentic AI.


I'm still working on something that I can present, and for now, I may just share a quote that I really like.

Any discussion, collaboration, and mentoring (both giving and receiving) are very welcome, and I can be reached at liyifan@link.cuhk.edu.hk. Thanks.
