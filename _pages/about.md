I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Prior to that, I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Artificial Intelligence from Xi'an Jiaotong University.
I am particularly interested in knowledge representation and reasoning, recommender systems.


I'm still working on something that I can present, and for now, I may just share a quote that I really like.

"Why do we have to listen to our hearts?" the boy asked.

"Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you will find your treasure."

Any discussion, co-operation, mentoring and being mentored are very welcome, and I can be reached at liyifan@link.cuhk.edu.hk.

Thanks for reading!
