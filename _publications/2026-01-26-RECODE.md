Large language models (LLMs) show the promise in supporting scientific research implementation, yet their ability to generate correct and executable code remains limited. Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE, a benchmark of 102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLMs through multi-turn interactions with human feedback. It includes structured instructions, unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to reflect realistic researcher–agent collaboration. We further present ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code generation. Experimentswith leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer feedback, while also highlighting ongoing challenges in the generation of complex research code. RECODE establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, feedback-driven LLM agents in scientific research implementation.
