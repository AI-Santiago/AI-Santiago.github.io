Undergraduate course

Offered by Prof. Liwei WANG, Spring 2025.

Natural language processing (NLP) is a crucial part of artificial intelligence (AI), which aims to endow computers with the ability to process human language. This course 
gives an overview of modern deep learning techniques for natural language processing. The course starts with basic linguistic concepts in NLP and moves from shallow 
bag-of-words representations to richer structural embeddings, which is the foundation for the successful use of deep learning in NLP. Then the course will guide you through
three fundamental tasks of NLP: language modeling (LM), natural language understanding (NLU), and natural language generation (NLG), followed by some recent 
advances such as BERT and adversarial learning. Along the way we will introduce cutting-edge computational models together with insights from a linguistic perspective.
