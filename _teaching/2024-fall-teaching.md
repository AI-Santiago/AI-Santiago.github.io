In this course, we will (i) introduce provably efficient algorithms for solving a set of classic problems that are frequently encountered in practice, (ii) extract from those algorithms the generic techniques that can be deployed to solve many other problems with strong performance guarantees, and (iii) study NP-hard/complete problems (that is, problems of which no polynomial time algorithms are known) and their approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems.
